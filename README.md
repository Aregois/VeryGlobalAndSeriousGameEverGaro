# VeryGlobalAndSeriousGameEverGaro

A browser-based 2D pseudo-3D shooter starring Garo, a one-man army fighting waves of alien monsters. The project targets vanilla HTML5 Canvas + CSS + JavaScript with no external libraries and ships as a single-page experience.

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge). No server required.
2. Click **Start** to begin the prototype horde mode. Use **WASD** to move, mouse to aim, hold left click to fire, **ESC** to pause. Use **Toggle Fullscreen** for an immersive view.
3. Survive the four test waves (a mix of Kamikazes and Kleers). If you fall, hit **Restart** and dive back in.

## Development plan
See `docs/development-plan.md` for the full production roadmap covering architecture, gameplay systems, levels, assets, and testing milestones.
