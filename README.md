# VeryGlobalAndSeriousGameEverGaro

A browser-based 2D pseudo-3D shooter starring Garo, a one-man army fighting waves of alien monsters. The project targets vanilla HTML5 Canvas + CSS + JavaScript with no external libraries and ships as a single-page experience.

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge). No server required.
2. Click **Start** to begin the prototype horde mode. Use **WASD** to move, mouse to aim, hold left click to fire, **1/2/3/4/5** (top row or numpad) to swap between the revolver, shotgun, Tommy Gun, Rocket Launcher, and Laser Gun, **ESC** to pause. Use **Toggle Fullscreen** for an immersive view.
3. Grab pickups between waves to heal, refill shells, SMG ammo, rockets, energy cells, and top up armor. Survive the seven test waves (Kamikazes, Kleers, Bio-Mech turret fire, charging Werebulls, and swooping Harpies). Rocket splash can hurt you too, so give yourself space. If you fall, hit **Restart** and dive back in.

## Development plan
See `docs/development-plan.md` for the full production roadmap covering architecture, gameplay systems, levels, assets, and testing milestones.
